            ARIES

            <div>
                <p>As the first sign in the zodiac, the presence of Aries always marks the beginning of something energetic and turbulent. They are continuously looking for dynamic, speed and competition, always being the first in everything - from work to social gatherings. Thanks to its ruling planet Mars and the fact it belongs to the element of Fire (just like Leo and Sagittarius), Aries is one of the most active zodiac signs. It is in their nature to take action, sometimes before they think about it.</p>
                <p>The Sun in such high dignity gives them excellent organizational skills, so you'll rarely meet an Aries who isn't capable of finishing several things at once, often before lunch break! Their challenges show when they get impatient, aggressive and vent anger pointing it to other people. Strong personalities born under this sign have a task to fight for their goals, embracing togetherness and teamwork through this incarnation.</p>
                <p>Aries rules the head and leads with the head, often literally walking head first, leaning forwards for speed and focus. Its representatives are naturally brave and rarely afraid of trial and risk. They possess youthful strength and energy, regardless of their age and quickly perform any given tasks.</p>

                <p>Aries the Ram ranks 11th smallest out of the 12 zodiac constellations. December is a great month to spot it, and if you do, consider yourself one of the special few who have tracked it down. Aries has few bright stars, yet there is still much to see here. Itâ€™s home to the Northern Fly asterism, and the planet Uranus is currently taking up residence within its borders.</p>
