                <p>Scorpios are passionate and assertive people with determination and focus you rarely see in other zodiac signs. They will turn to in-depth research to reach the truth behind anything they find important. Great leaders and guides, Scorpios are resourceful, dedicated and fearless when there is challenge to be overcome. They will hold on to other people’s secrets, even when they aren’t very fond of them to begin with and do anything they can for those they tie themselves to.</p>
                <p>This is a Water sign, just as Cancer and Pisces, and its representatives have to experience, express and face emotions. Always fighting dishonesty of any kind, they have to learn not to manipulate or turn people to look their way by methods that aren’t straightforward and clean. These inner tendencies sometimes make them distrustful and jealous, suspicion leading them to strange behavioral patterns they have to unveil.</p>
                <p>The rulers of Scorpio are Pluto and Mars, one of them being the planet of transformation and regeneration, and the other pushing them forwards and providing them with enough initiative to build their lives energetic and strong. These individuals are known for being calm and cool, looking mysterious and hard to figure out. There is a deep understanding of the rules of the Universe inside every Scorpio that gives them the power others rush through life rarely recognizing within.</p>

                <p>As the boundaries are presently defined, the sun spends close to three weeks in front of the constellation Ophiuchus (November 29-December 18). Ophiuchus is the constellation immediately to the north of Scorpius. Note on the sky chart above that the IAU chose to draw most of the Ophiuchus-Scorpius border to the south of the ecliptic. Had the IAU chosen to draw the border to the north of the ecliptic, then the sun’s duration within Scorpius would be closer to one month.
